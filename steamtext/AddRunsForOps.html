<h2>Add Runs for <i>Ops</i>

</h2>This form is for a <i>series of runs</i> for an Operations track.  If you want to 
edit an existing run, click a link in the table, please. You can add just one run here, 
just enter 1 as the number of blocks.
<br /><br />
Use this form by providing a title, select a day and a start time. Select the # of hours, 
and the number of sessions <i>for a day</i>.You must repeat the form for each day.  
Runs will naturally occur sequentially - for example if you select 8 sessions, of 1 hour, 
starting 9AM, you will get 1 run an hour from 9AM to 5PM.<br /><br />Choosing a room is 
optional.  If your event takes place in a location notshown, then add a location note on 
where to meet.<br /><br />

<b>Special Ops Types</b>
<br><br>
<u>Please take note!</u>  There are now special types of Ops runs in the GBE system!  
These types control particular functionality in the website, and behavior will look and 
feel very strange to regular participants and performers if the types are not used properly!
<b>BEFORE</b> selecting a special type, please take note:<br>
<UL>
  <LI><b>Tech Rehearsals</b> - Tech Rehearsal are the open volunteer positions for tech
  crew.  A Tech Rehearsal will be always visible on the schedule and will allow any 
  registered user to sign up (as usual), so long as slots are available.  A Tech Rehearsal 
  must be linked to a Show special event, and signing up for a tech rehearsal will also 
  register the user for the call before the show.</LI>
  <LI><b>Act Rehearsal Slot</b> - Act Rehearsal Slots are hour long blocks in which 
  performers can book rehearsal time during tech rehearsal.  Act Rehearsal Slots are visible 
  only to stage managers and the performers booked for the given show.  They do not show
  up on the general schedule.</LI>
  <LI><b>Call</b> - The time before the show that the cast and crew must show up.  Anyone 
  who is booked for a show as the cast, or who volunteers for tech rehearsal will also be 
  booked for the call and the show.  The call only shows up for those involved in the show, 
  it is not generally visible.</LI>
</UL>

These three special types are linked together by the choice of show.  You can't book any of 
these without identifying the show name.  This helps stage managers coordinate all the work 
needed for a given show.
