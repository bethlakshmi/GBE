<div>Our form has changed since last year.  <b>Please read over everything carefully, and fill out the form to the best of your ability.</b><br />
<br />
Stop.  Seriously.  Most fields have little hints and instructions next to them.  Read them.  We've tried to make them both useful <i>and</i> entertaining.<br />
<br />
<b>Incomplete applications will not be accepted</b>, but we'll bug you to let you know your form isn't complete.<br />
<br />
<b>Unpaid applications will not be accepted</b> but we'll send you a PayPal invoice so you can settle up before Jan. 15th.<br />
<br />
<big>There are four potential performance slots for applicants on three nights:</big> <br />
<ul><li><b>Friday night, March 29</b> during <i>The Last Chance Casino Party</i>.  This isn't the same thing as <i>The Rhinestone Review</i> which is earlier in the evening on Friday and invitation only.  Performances at <i>The Last Chance Party</i> are on a small (8'x8') stage, are non-competition, and are best suited for solos or duets.  This is limited to 10-15 acts of varying lengths. <em>We are also accepting NON-burlesque variety acts for this show</em></li><li><b>Saturday night, March 30</b> <i>The Main Event</i>, where you can perform either in competition or in exhibition (while the judges or off selecting the winners).  The competition portion of The Main Event is limited to about 25 acts <b>each act in competition has a maximum length of four minutes and fifteen seconds (04:15)</b>. Most people don't get in the first time they apply, so don't feel badly if you don't get in.</li><li><b>Sunday night, March 31</b> <i>The Original Newcomer's Showcase</i>  We don't have a hard cut-off for what a 'newcomer' is.  We use our judgment based on the biographical information you provide us. Someone who has been performing for only a year but has already been in three festivals and dances regularly in a weekly showcase is technically "newer" than someone who has been performing for three years, but only performs once or twice a year.  We accept 10-15 performers for this show.</li><li><b>Sunday night, March 31</b> <i>The Sideshow Ball</i> is the second part of Sunday's entertainment.  It's for freaks, geeks, and variety entertainers.  In past years we've had belly dancers, snake charmers, magicians, mentalists, comedians, grinder girls, sword swallowers, hula hoopers, watchamacallems and thingamawhosits.  We accept 8-10 acts for this show.<br />

At minimum, before applying, you'll want to know what act you're going to do, have a picture of yourself and video (preferably of the act with which you are applying), and have a little burlesque resume.  Oh, and a PayPal account, checkbook, or credit card.<br />
