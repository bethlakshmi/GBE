<H3><A name=Benefits>Benefits</A></H3>
<P>
There are benefits to being a GM for <?echo CON_NAME ?>.</p> 

<H3><I><A name=CompedMemberships>Comped Memberships</A></I></H3>
<!--
<P>Each game gets <I>two</I> comped memberships to the con. These free 
memberships can be used by the game in any manner they see fit.</p>
<P>Intercon runs on a very tight budget. We'd like to comp every GM, but it is 
not financially possible for us to comp more than two people for each game. If 
you need six GMs for your game, at least four of them will have to buy 
memberships in the con.</p>-->
<p>GM Comping policy TBD.</P>

<H3><I><A name=Advertising>Advertising</A></I></H3>
<P>We make a concerted effort to get word about all of our games out as far and 
as wide as we can. Your event is part of that advertising. If you have specific 
advertising material, please make sure our <a href=<? echo mailto_url (EMAIL_OUTREACH, 'Advertising'); ?>>Outreach Coordinator</a>
 has copies, so that we can distribute it wherever we go. </P>

<P>Word of mouth is the most powerful tool we have in promoting The Symposium, and 
our GMs are our best promoters. We'd appreciate your help in getting players to 
register for your event, and for others. With your help, we can make this the best Steampunk Symposium ever. </P>

<P>Try and encourage other folks to register now, if you can. We want to start a 
positive feedback loop. The earlier we can announce a strong schedule, the more 
players will be attracted to the con. That will mean we'll have to go out and 
find more events, which will draw more players, and so on... If you know of 
people who want to participate in your event, tell them the best way to guarantee their 
spot is to <I>register now</I>. That will allow them to sign up online as soon 
as we open registration. </P>
<HR>

<H3><A name=Policies>Policies</A></H3>
<P>For the most part, the staff of The Symposium and the hotel are somewhat lax about 
what you can and cannot do during the convention. There are a few rules, 
however, that do need to be followed. It is important to follow these policies, 
otherwise the Con may not be welcomed back to the hotel. 
<H3><I><A name=RegistrationPolicy>Game Registrations</A></I></H3>
<P><?echo CON_NAME?> follows a strict first come, first serve policy when it comes to 
game registrations. If there is someone who <I>must</I> be in your game, the 
best solution is to have them sign up early, to make sure they get in. 
Alternatively, you have the option of making them a GM for your game.</p>
<P>We recognize the fact that there are players out there that may be difficult 
to deal with. However, we cannot and do not discriminate. If a player signs up 
for your game, we expect that you will do your best to give them a part that is 
appropriate.</p>
<P>The <I>only</I> exception to this rule is if there is some legal restriction 
that should exclude a player from your game. For example, if your game is a 
live combat game, there may be insurance reasons that require restrictions, 
such as insurance waivers, for pregnant women and players under the age of 16. 
In these cases, please contact the <a href=<? echo mailto_url (EMAIL_CON_CHAIR, 'Question'); ?>>
Con Chair</A>. </p>

<h3><i><a name=WeaponPolicy>Weapons</a></i></h3>
<p>Weapons policy TBD.</p>
<!--<p>
The hotel is very concerned about scaring the mundanes with real looking 
weapons (and rightfully so). As such, they have requested that <i>any weapons 
used in a game must be obvious fakes</i>. The Intercon staff recognizes that 
this may not be practical for all games as tone and mood setting are very 
important aspects of a LARP. If your game requires the use of weapons that could 
be construed as real, we ask the following: 
<ul>
<li>If at all possible, please keep all weapon props behind closed doors. 
<li>If the players need to leave the function space (or travel from one function 
room to another), make sure your players have blades sheathed and guns hidden. 
We will be on extra alert for this given that recent current events have 
hypersensitized people to any threats of violence. 
<LI><I>Absolutely no combat (with fake or real-looking weapons) may take place in the 
<B>public</B> hallway areas</I>. </LI>
</UL>
<P>If this policy is not strictly adhered to, the hotel has the right to expel 
the player or game in question without warning. Intercon staff will issue one 
warning; if this policy is violated a second time, the player and/or the game 
may asked to leave. </p> -->
<H3><I><A name=AlcoholPolicy>Alcohol</A></I></H3>
<p>Alcohol policy TBD.</p>
<!--
<P>Because of the hotel's liquor license and strict Massachusetts state law, 
alcohol may only be served by a bartender from the hotel. Players and GMs may 
not bring their own alcohol into the game space. If a GM would like to have a 
real bar for their game, we can <A href="#BarService">make arrangements with the 
hotel</A>. 
<P>Players, GMs, or Games found in violation of this policy will be asked to 
remove the alcohol from the game space immediately. If they do not comply, they 
will be asked to leave the hotel. If you opt to have a bartender, the bartender 
will card your players. </p> -->

<H3><I><A name=FirePolicy>Candles, Fire, and Fog Machines</A></I></H3>
<p>Policy TBD.</p>
<!--<P>Candles are allowed as long as they are contained in a glass holder that is 
at least as tall as the flame.</p>-->

<H3><I><A name=WallHangingPolicy>Wall Hangings and Signs</A></I></H3>
<p>DO NOT, in any way, place signage or attach anything to the walls, doors or any other part of the Queen Mary. 
The Queen Mary is a historic vessel and has strict and EXPENSIVE rules governing the placement of signs.</p>
<p>Should you need a sign, please contact 
<a href=<? echo mailto_url (EMAIL_CON_CHAIR, 'Signage'); ?>>The Con Chair</a> 
and an appropriate sign will be constructed and placed for you.</p>

<HR>

<H3><A name=Services>Services</A></H3>
<P>There are several services that the con can provide for your game. There are 
other services that we can arrange with the hotel. </p>

<H3><I><A name=SpaceService>Game Space</A></I></H3>
<P>It is important that you let us know your space requirements as soon as you 
understand those requirements. We cannot guarantee that you will receive the 
room(s) that you request. We need to know your sense of space requirements in 
general; we will do our best to give you the best possible game space. However, 
we have to fit all of the event at the con in your timeslot(s), which may mean 
some creativity in meeting your space needs. Final space assignments are 
probably not possible until a month or so before the convention. </p>

<P>High speed Internet Access is also available on a per connection (person) 
basis. Prices are on a sliding scale based on the number of connections. NOTE: 
If you are staying in a Suite at the hotel, wireless Internet access is provided 
for that room free of charge (if you want your Suite to be part of your game 
area). -->
<P>The prices are subject to change over the course of the year; we will get 
you a final quote when you make your request. 
We'll need to work with the hotel for costs, and we'll do that as the date of 
the con draws nearer. </p>

<P>
The Symposium Operations Staff are available throughout the Con to assist you. 
They will help you set up if time and people are available. 
If you need anything from the hotel staff, please contact Ops.  
Ops and hotel staff will also be around during the running of your event.</p>

<p>
If you know that your event may have a difficult set up or break down, 
let the GM Coordinator and Bid Chair know so we can schedule your game appropriately.</p>

<p>Remember:  You may <em>NOT</em> hang items, including signs, on the walls of the Queen Mary</p>
 
<H3><I><A name=HotelService>Hotel Negotiations and Arrangements</A></I></H3>
<P>
We ask that you let the Symposium Staff make the arrangements for  
equipment and food for your event. Depending on the demands of the con, we may be able to 
negotiate a lower rate for you individually. (At the very least, if we know 
several people want to use a resource, the cost can be split evenly among them).</p>
