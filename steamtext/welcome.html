<h2>Welcome to The Great Burlesque Exposition!</h2>

Whether this is your first time here or you're a repeat visitor to 
<i>The Great Burlesque Exposition</i> (GBE), you're in for a treat!  We're an annual gathering
of Burlesque performers, teachers, aficionados, newcomers and fans!  With nightly shows, 
day time classes, vendors from all parts of the globe, and a variety of special events - 
there's something for everyone.
</br></br>
The 8th annual exhibition will be bigger and better than ever.  With our daytime conference 
content, we've become a must-visit hot spot for Burlesque professionals looking to develop 
their artistic and business skills.  Each year we strive to bring you the best new teachers 
and most well-loved teachers from previous years.  We highly recommend our Whole Shebang package,
which is absolutely the best value for making the most of all the conference, shows, and everything
the conference has to offer.  But if you're just starting out, and want a mere taste, we recommend
the Fan Admission - a low cost, high value pass to selected free classes provided by the award 
winning Boston Academy of Burlesque Education (B.A.B.E), as well as some of our special events 
and access to our amazing vendors!
</br></br>
Our shows bring together talent from around the world, with a different focus each night.  
From the Rhinestone Review featuring famous favorites of today to the Original Newcomer's Showcase
we have an opportunity for any experience level.  Our Main Event is a must watch pantheon of 
amazing and polished acts that will dazzle and delight you, even as performers compete for the
titles of being the Best at the Great Burlesque Expo.  To bring even more opportunity, we also 
feature the wonderful variety performers who spice up our lives with the Variety Showcase, and for
those who can't get enough - and additional themed party on Friday night.
</br></br>
Along with a huge collection of content presented by a legion of performers, teachers and panelists,
the Expo provides a great chance for shopping, meeting up with old and new friends, and a collection
of events that are special for our community such as the Pool Party, Lunch with the Legends, 
(new this year!) a fashion show.
