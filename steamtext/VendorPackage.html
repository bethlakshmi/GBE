<h2>Vending Opportunities</h2>
<center><h3>The Great Burlesque Exposition is the fastest growing event in the 
burlesque world.</h3>

A unique combination of performance festival, professional development conference, and 
tradeshow â€” we expect as many as 1,000 people to travel from all over the world to 
attend our event this year!</center>

As we have been for the past six years, we are at the luxurious 
<a href="http://cambridge.hyatt.com">Hyatt Regency Cambridge</a> (575 Memorial Drive, 
Cambridge, MA).   The conference hotel is minutes from Harvard Square, Central Square, 
and M.I.T. There is plenty of parking and a shuttle bus from the MBTA for those shoppers
 without cars.  Discounted parking is available at the hotel's garage and there is a 
 loading dock for those vendors who need it.
</br></br>
We strongly encourage <i>all</i> exhibitors (not just salon vendors) to stay at the 
Conference Hotel. Carting your goods back and forth, or having to run back to another 
hotel if you have forgotten something is no fun for anyone.
</br></br>
We will do our best to get everyone in; priority will be given to those who get their 
applications in earliest. We also consider whether your product or service is 
appropriate for the burlesque community and similarity to other vendors (i.e., the 
third vendor of a particular type of good or service is going to have a harder time 
getting in than the first vendor of that type).
</br></br>
We strongly suggest you get your complete forms in as early as possible. We will not 
"hold" a booth for you if you send an application without payment. Any vendor who is 
not accepted for any reason will receive a full refund.
</br></br>
Your suggestions, feedback, and ideas are always welcome. If you have any questions 
about the exhibit space, don't hesitate to contact us at (617) 869-2000 or via 
<a href="mailto:sales@burlesque-expo.com">email</a>.  We are easiest to reach Monday 
through Friday in the afternoon (East Coast Time).

        Located next to the theater, The Vendor's Hall is the heart of <i>The Great 
        Burlesque Exposition</i>.  <b>This year, we are limiting the number of dealers 
        to 36 tables.</b>  We are opening the Exhibit Hall for Vendors on Saturday, 
        March 30 and Sunday, March 31 from noon until 8:00 p.m., although you may 
        elect to vend only on Saturday.  Staying open until 8:00 p.m. allows you 
        to sell to both the conference attendees and those who only come for the 
        Saturday evening show.
        </br></br>
        We have a wide variety of events designed to draw customers - both casual and 
        conference - to the show floor. We're pleased to announce the return of our art 
        show, featuring pin-up drawings and photography, autograph signing sessions with 
        our VIPs, and our spectacular costume exhibit. There is also a lounge area for 
        visitors in the Vendor Hall to encourage them to linger during their shopping.
        </br></br>
        Each 8x8 space rental includes two chairs and fan admission passes for your staff.  
        <b><i>Please note:</i></b> All your merchandise must fit within your space. 
        You are welcome to bring racks, stands, displays, etc.  We also rent tables 
        to vendors who prefer not to bring them.
        </br></br>
        The current rate for a space in The Vendor's Hall is $150 for the weekend or 
        $125.00 for Saturday only.
        </br></br>
        <b><i>Can I buy more than one space?</i></b>
        </br></br>
        Yes, but any space you purchase beyond the first one will have an additional 
        $25.00 added on to your base rate (i.e., if your first booth is $125.00 any 
        additional booths will be $150.00).  This is to allow for as much vendor 
        diversity as possible.

        <font size=2><h4>Salon Vending</h2>
        
        For those vendors who wish more space or who wish to sell all weekend, we are 
        offering <b>Salon Vending</b>, where you can rent a hotel room and use that to 
        sell your wares. Some vendors need more space or more privacy than can be had in 
        The Main Exhibit Hall. This is particularly true for those vendors who do custom 
        clothing or want to provide prospective customers with a fitting room. Salon 
        vendors must rent a room at the hotel; all vendors will be placed next to one 
        another on the second floor of the hotel, adjacent to the restaurant. There 
        will be signage throughout the event space promoting the Salon Vendors.
        </br></br>       
        There are only 17 Salon Vendor spaces available: 10 King rooms (rooms with 
        one King-sized bed) and 7 rooms with two double beds.
        </br></br>
        Salon Vendor space is only $75. for the weekend. <i>Note: </i>This does 
        <b>NOT</b> include the price of the room ($129.00 per night); you are 
        responsible for renting your own hotel room. Hotel staff will remove furniture 
        from the room for a small additional fee.
