<H3>Volunteering</H3>
<p>Our convention is the result of the work of many people, all 
pitching in. We welcome new people; there's no experience necessary. (After all, 
many of us had never run a convention before we started.)</p> 

<P>Whether it's an hour or two at the con or an hour or two a month leading up 
to the con, we welcome the help. You'll be working with a great group of people.</p> 

<P>Send us a note to <A href=<? echo mailto_url (EMAIL_CON_CHAIR, 'Volunteer!'); ?>>help out by volunteering</A>!</p>

<p>Thanks!</P>
