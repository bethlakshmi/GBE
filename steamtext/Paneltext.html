<h2>Panel Proposal Instructions</h2>

Panels at the Expo are comprised of a collection of notable personalities and experts
discussing a topic of interest to the GBE community.  Topics can include aspects of 
the Burlesque business, performance choices, political issues or any other subject
that can have an impact on the scene.  The best panels are those that get us thinking
 and talking about how to make the community better.<br />
<br />
Submitting a panel idea does not require or imply that you must sit on the panel as a 
moderator or panelist.  If you're interested in sitting on a panel - go to the "Sit on a Panel"
page to volunteer for panels that are under current consideration for this year's Expo.
