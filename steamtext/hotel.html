We're thrilled to be returning to the Hyatt Regency Cambridge, our home for the past seven years.  Ask anyone who has attended The Exposition in the past, The Hyatt provides luxury accommodations at economy rates.  The hotel features a pool and  fitness center. 
</br></br>
You can stay in this four star hotel on the banks of the Charles River for only $109.00 per night (plus tax) if you <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/e7faff68">book on-line</a> before November 30, 2013.  After December 1, rates go up to $109.00 for a single or double.  Triples and quads are also available for a very reasonable rate!
</br></br>
The Hyatt Regency is approximately 3/4 of a mile from the <em>Boston University &#8211; West</em> T stop (B branch of the green line) and one mile from the <em>Central Square</em> T stop (red line). Central Square is also served by the #1, #47, #64, #70, #83, #91, and CT1 bus lines.For more information on Boston's mass transit system, please visit <a href="http://www.mbta.com">MBTA.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
