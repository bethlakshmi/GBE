<h2>Shopping!</h2>

<i>The Great Burlesque Exposition</i> has it all under one roof: shows, classes, special 
exhibits, and shopping, shopping, shopping! Interested in <a href="Static.php?page=VendorPackage">selling your stuff</a>? We have 
just a few spaces left!
</br></br>
The Vendor Hall is open from noon to 8:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday and is located in 
President's Ballroom D on the main floor of the hotel.
</br></br>
Salon Vendors have booked a room in the hotel to turn into a 'pop-up' store for the 
weekend.  They set their own hours, so check the signage on-site to see what their 
hours are and what rooms they're in!
</br></br>
Admission to The Vendor Hall is included with the purchase of a Whole Shebang Weekend 
Pass, any conference registration, or a ticket to any show. Just want to come and shop?
