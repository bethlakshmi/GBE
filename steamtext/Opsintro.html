<h2>Volunteering</h2>
There are a ton of great reasons to  volunteer: it's a fabulous way to get to meet new people from all over the world;  it's a fun way to learn a new skill; and it gets you a discount on your registration for <U>next</u> year (yes, that's new). <em>The Great Burlesque Exposition</em> is a non-profit adventure, which thrives or fails largely on the hard work of its volunteers.  Sadly, we've problems in the past of people who promised to volunteer, got a discount, and never showed up.  Because of those bad apples, we've had to change our volunteering and discount policies.
<P>We want you to join our team and be one of the folks who makes The Great Burlesque Exposition run!  Volunteering is easy! Just click on the job you want below to get more information about it.  If you decide you want to volunteer for a shift, click the day and time you want to sign up for and add it will be added to your schedule. <EM>Please note:</em> some volunteer shifts require special skills and approval by the area heads.  Also, some volunteer positions require you sign up for two shifts (for example, to be a <I>Follow Spot Operator</I> at The Main Event, you need to both be at rehearsal and at the show).
<P>The Volunteer Office is in the Media Room, the office with the glass door which is just to your left if you're facing the revolving doors out of the hotel.  Be sure to come in for your time-sheet, free T-shirt, and whatever other nifty stuff we can dig up for volunteers.
<h3>What Do I Get?</h3>
If you're volunteering just to get something... don't.  Everyone, from our Exposition Chair to the Conference Committee to the person who helps out for just an hour is an unpaid volunteer.  Those folks are giving their time to help make the The Great Burlesque Exposition truly great.  Just being a volunteer brings its own satisfaction. Without volunteers, we wouldn't have this amazing weekend.  That said, we love our volunteers and do our best to reward them:
<UL>
<LI> Working even one shift at The Expo this year means you can get a free <B>Fan Admission</b>
