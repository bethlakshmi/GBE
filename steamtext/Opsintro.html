<h2>Volunteering</h2>
The Great Burlesque Exposition is a non-profit adventure, which thrives or fails 
largely on the hard work of its volunteers.  There are a ton of great reasons to 
volunteer: it's a fabulous way to get to meet new people from all over the world; 
it's a fun way to learn a new skill; and it gets you a discount on your registration 
for The Whole Shebang.
