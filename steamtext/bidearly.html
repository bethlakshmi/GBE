<h3>Why Bid Early?</h3>
<p>There are several great reasons to get your event bid in early:
<ul>
<li>You're likelier to get the time slot you desire. As the
schedule fills, the prime time slots fill up.
<li>Your game gets more publicity and advertising. It's likelier
to fill earlier, which will give you more time to cast and plan.
<li>You get a better chance at attracting the congoers who know that
it's smart to sign up early for events.
<li>You might miss your chance to bid at all if you wait.
</ul>
