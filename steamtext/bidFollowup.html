<H3>The Bid Process</H3>
<P>Here's what happens once you've filled out the <A href="Bids.php">bid 
form</A>: 
<OL>
<LI>The <A href="mailto:bids@interactiveliterature.org">Bid Chair</A> will be 
notified of your bid. The Bid Chair will read the information you've 
supplied. If there are any immediate questions, the Bid Chair will contact 
you, to work with you to clarify your bid.<BR>&nbsp; 
<LI>The Bid Chair notifies the Bid Committee of the new bid. The Bid 
Committee consists of several con volunteers, with a wide variety of LARP 
experience, at Intercon and elsewhere. The Bid Committee is deliberately large 
and varied, in order to represent the diversity of people who come to the con. 
Several people will look at your bid.<BR>&nbsp; 
<LI>The Bid Committee discusses each bid. <A name=whatWeLookFor>They'll be 
looking at the bid for answers to questions such as:</A><BR>&nbsp; 
<UL>
<LI>Does the game look interesting? 
<LI>Does it look like a game that people will enjoy? 
<LI>Is this a game that will appeal to the <A 
href="Static.php?page=bidFAQ#audience">typical Intercon audience</A>? 
<LI>Is it a game that's different from games already accepted for the 
convention? 
<LI>Is this a game that helps to create a rich and varied mix of games at the 
con? 
<LI>Do the game space and time requirements fit within the Intercon budget for 
space and time? 
<LI>Will the game bring new people into the con? </LI></UL>
<P>This may result in further questions back to you. It is why it's so important 
that you fill in the bid form completely to begin with.<BR>&nbsp; </P>
<LI>Once consensus has been reached, the Bid Chair will notify the Con 
Chair. The Con Chair is the final arbiter of game acceptance. When the Con Chair 
has made a decision, the Bid Chair will let you know what has been 
decided.<BR>&nbsp; 
<LI>If the bid is accepted, it will be added to the schedule. Announcements 
about the con will contain advertisements about all the open games in the 
schedule, including yours! We also encourage you to advertise your game (and 
Intercon) in your LARP group. 
<P>If the bid is rejected, we'll try to explain why it doesn't meet our needs. 
We get a lot of game bids, and some just don't fit. If your bid is rejected, we 
hope you'll still come to the convention, to have a great time in all of the 
other LARPs.<BR>&nbsp; </P></LI></OL>
<P>Still have questions? Please drop a note to the <A 
href="mailto:bids@interactiveliterature.org">Bid Chair</A>. We want to make it easy 
for you to bid your game. </P>
