<P>Thank you for your interest!<P>
<h1>The Proposal Process</h1>
Once you have submitted to teach, here is what will happen: 
<p>
The class coordinator will read the submission and share it with the 
committee.  If the class is extremely skill specific, we might share it 
with a specialist outside of the committee.  For example, no one currently 
on the committee is a ballroom dancer and would therefore ask for help to 
judge the viability of a ballroom dance based class.  
</p><p>
The education committee will discuss each submission and look at criteria 
including the type of class, if we have too many other similar classes, our 
guess as to the interest it will generate amongst participants, flexibility 
and cooperation with the education committee and other Expo coordinators, 
reliability, and ease of contact.  If we cannot locate you to ask questions, 
we will move on to another potential teacher.
</p><p>
If your class is accepted, we will let you know and begin working on 
scheduling.  If, after your acceptance, you realize you will be unable to 
attend the Expo, you must let us know as soon as possible.  Not only does 
the education committee need to know which classes are going to take place, 
but programs need to be printed, the web site needs to be updated, and so 
on.  If you cancel at the last minute without an emergency, you will not be 
permitted to teach at the Expo in future years.</p><p>
If your class is wait listed, we will let you know if we need it as soon 
as we know.  You will have the option of letting us know your deadline 
for needing a definite answer.  We do not expect you to put all of your 
plans on hold in case someone cancels!</p><p>
If the class does not quite meet our needs, we might contact you about your 
willingness to adapt it, teach a different class for which we feel you have 
the experience, or speak on a panel.</p><p>
If your class is rejected, we will try to explain why we could not use it.  
We get many applications, and we cannot use them all.  Even if  you end up 
not teaching, we would love to see you at the Expo and enjoying the other 
events.</p><p>

<h3>Thank you!</h3>
