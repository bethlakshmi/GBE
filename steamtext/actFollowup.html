<H3>The Act Submission Process</H3>
<P>Here's what happens once you've filled out the <A href="Acts.php">bid 
form</A>: 
<OL>
<LI>The <A href="mailto:shows@burlesque-expo.com">Head of the Performance Selection 
Committee</A> will be notified of your submission. The Head will read the information you've 
supplied. If there are any immediate questions, the Head will contact 
you, to work with you to clarify your act.<BR>&nbsp; 
<LI>The Head notifies the Performance Selection Committee of the new bid. The  
Committee consists of several volunteers, with a wide variety of Burlesque  
experience from across the country, at the Expo and elsewhere. The Performance Selection Committee is deliberately large 
and varied, in order to represent the diversity of people who come to the con. 
Several people will look at your act.<BR>&nbsp; 
<LI>The Performance Selection Committee discusses each act. <A name=whatWeLookFor>They'll be 
looking at the bid for answers to questions such as:</A><BR>&nbsp; 
<UL>
<LI>Does the act fit any of our special themes? 
<LI>Is the act clearly described and does it have video? 
<LI>Does this act fit the <A 
href="Static.php?page=actFAQ#audience">rules and guidelines<a/> for acts at the Expo? 
<LI>What is the artist or troupe eligible for based upon experience? 
<LI>Does the length of the act fit our limitations for each night? 
<LI>Will the act bring new people into the con? </LI>
<LI>What other contributions has the performer brought to the Expo? </LI>
</UL>
<P>This may result in further questions back to you. It is why it's so important 
that you fill in the form completely to begin with.<BR>&nbsp; </P>
<LI>If the act is accepted, it will be added to a show within our schedule. Announcements 
about the con will contain advertisements about all the act in each show, including yours! 
We also encourage you to advertise your act (and The Great Burlesque Expo!) in your 
local area and with your fans. </LI>
<LI>If your act is accepted, you can expect several follow up emails from the Expo.  
We'll ask you to fill out a performer or troupe bio for our promotions, give further 
technical details for our stage crew, and send us your music ahead of time.  We'll 
also ask that you book a rehearsal slot the day of the show and attend it.  Please stay 
tuned to your email, lack of timely response can mean that your act is withdrawn from 
the show.</LI>
<P>If the act is rejected, we'll try to explain why it doesn't meet our needs. 
We get a lot of acts, and some just don't fit. If your act is rejected, we 
hope you'll still come to the Expo, to have a great time in all of the 
other great opportunities.<BR>&nbsp; </P></LI></OL>
<P>Still have questions? Please drop a note to the <A 
href="mailto:info@burlesque-expo.com">Head</A>. We want to make it easy 
for you to submit your act. </P>
