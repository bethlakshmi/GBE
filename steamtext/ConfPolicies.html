<P>
There are benefits to being a presenter at the conference for <?echo CON_NAME ?>.</p>

There are benefits to being a GM for <?php echo CON_NAME ?>.</p> >>>>>>> f2cecaad5ad284703c4a159ceccd3b2b033e0153

<H3><I><A name=CompedMemberships>Comped Passes</A></I></H3>
<!--
<P>Each game gets <I>two</I> comped memberships to the con. These free 
memberships can be used by the game in any manner they see fit.</p>
<P>Intercon runs on a very tight budget. We'd like to comp every GM, but it is 
not financially possible for us to comp more than two people for each game. If 
you need six GMs for your game, at least four of them will have to buy 
memberships in the con.</p>-->
<p>The Great Burlesque Expo policy is to offer free entrance to the part of the event
to which you are contributing.  For conference contributors such as teachers, this includes
a day time pass to the day on which you are teaching.  For those who have gone above and 
beyond <i>ahead of the convention</i> - we offer additional discounts for tickets, passes, 
and other admissions.  Volunteering at the convention will provide the opportunity for 
discounts in the <i>future year</i>.</P>

<H3><I><A name=Advertising>Advertising</A></I></H3>
<P>We make a concerted effort to get word about all of our conference content out as far and 
as wide as we can. You are a part of that advertising. If you have specific 
advertising material, please make sure our <a href=<? echo mailto_url (EMAIL_OUTREACH, 'Advertising'); ?>>Outreach Coordinator</a>
 has copies, so that we can distribute it wherever we go. </P>

<P>Word of mouth is the most powerful tool we have in promoting The Expo, and 
our teachers, panelists and performers are our best promoters. We'd appreciate your help 
in telling your friends and fans to come see you at the Expo. With your help, we can 
make this the best Expo ever! </P>

<P>Try and encourage other folks to register now, if you can.  Not only do we offer great 
discounts for early registration, we want to start a positive feedback loop. The 
earlier we can announce a strong schedule, the more folks will be attracted to the Expo. 
That will mean we'll have to go out and find more classes, acts, panels and other fun 
activities, which will draw more people, and so on... If you know of 
people who want to watch you or learn from you, tell them the best way to guarantee their 
spot is to <I>register now</I>. That will allow them to sign up online as soon 
as we open registration. </P>
<HR>

<H3><A name=Policies>Policies</A></H3>
<P>The staff of The Expo and the hotel are welcoming and eager to help.  We're a favorite
part of the Hyatt's yearly schedule, and that's due, in part, to the fun, friendly and spontaneous 
nature of our community.  We like to keep that good feeling going (if ya know what we 
mean!! ;) ).  To do that, we need your help!

<H3><I><A name=RegistrationPolicy>Conference Attendance</A></I></H3>
<P>With the majority of classes and panels, there is no maximum size on 
classes.  We balance the number of classes to keep attendees engaged and classes of an 
appropriate size, but on occasion we can have very low or very high attendance.  We ask that
teachers be ready to handle this varying class size, unless they are teaching Master Classes 
or Workshops.  We ask that teachers be ready for a class size of anywhere from 3 to 20.  If 
class handouts are required, please plan to bring at least 10.</p>

<p>Master Classes and Workshops are first come/first serve.  Master classes are pre-paid 
and pre-registered - if you're running a master class, you'll get a list from the conference 
staff 10 minutes before your class with the list of signups.  Workshop fees are paid to the 
instructor - please bring change appropriate to your class fees.  If you must limit the class 
size of a workshop, please be sure your workshop description clarifies the fee and what materials
will be provided</p>

<P>We recognize the fact that there are unique personalities out there that may be difficult 
to deal with. However, we cannot and do not discriminate.  We know that as experienced 
teachers, moderators, and panelists, you'll use your best judgement and communication 
skills to provide a positive experience for everyone.  With that said, we do not condone 
offensive or unsafe behavior - if you believe that an attendee poses a threat to others, or 
will not obey the direct requests of the presenter - please do no hesitate to enlist the aid
of our security volunteers.</p>


<H3><I><A name=AlcoholPolicy>Alcohol</A></I></H3>
<p>Yes, there will be alcohol.  The hotel offers a full bar, and there is a bar in the theater 
space during every show.  Please drink responsibly and respectfully.  There are no glass 
containers of any kind (glasses, bottles, etc) during the pool party, courtesy plastic
cups will be available.</p>

<p>While drinking in private rooms is certainly condoned, please keep private drinking 
private and be respectful of guests in the hotel at later hours.  The Hyatt offers a 
friendly and open layout, with lots of balcony access.  This creates a wonderful feeling
 of shared community - and a LOT of echoes!  Please keep doors closed and the noise down after 
 hours to keep from getting a visit from security.  If you'd like to have a louder party, 
 please coordinate with Expo Hospitality to find an appropriate space.

<H3><I><A name=Nudity>Nudity</A></I></H3>
<p>No one loves delightful naked people more than we do!  Trust us!  But here's a few 
guidelines for great times to strut your stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>On Stage</b> - our general policy on stage is pasties and panties or a reasonable 
simulation thereof.  Please check in with your stage manager for further judgement.</li>
<li><b>In Class</b> - our movement room is fully private - feel free to shake whatever you've 
got, with respect to the nature of the class and your teacher's guidance.  The lecture and 
workshop rooms have windows that face the driveway that can be closed with blinds - please use
good judgement.</li>
<li><b>Public Spaces</b> - please bear in mind that not every guest in the Hyatt is a 
participant in the Expo, and don't give it away for free.  If they aren't tipping you, keep it 
to yourself.</li>
</ul>

<HR>

<H3><A name=Services>Services</A></H3>
<P>There are several services that the con can provide for you and your class and panel. </p>

<H3><I><A name=SpaceService>Class Space</A></I></H3>
<P>It is important that you let us know your space requirements as soon as you 
understand those requirements. We cannot guarantee that you will receive the 
room(s) that you request. We need to know your sense of space requirements in 
general; we will do our best to give you the best possible room. However, 
we have to fit all of the event at the con in your timeslot(s), which may mean 
some creativity in meeting your space needs. Final space assignments are not 
possible until a month or so before the convention. </p>

<H3><I><A name=FurnitureService>Tables, Chairs and Furniture</A></I></H3>
<P>We keep our furniture layout fairly formalized to minimize the reset time 
needed between classes, so we can fit more great content into every Expo!  Please
keep in mind these basic layouts when planning your class:
<ul>
<li><b>Movement Room</b> - the movement room is a wide open space with a limited mirror 
in one corner of the room.  It will have some chairs stacked on the edge of the room.  Ideally,
the room will include a dance floor, although the bare room is carpeted.  Giving us guidance in your 
bid really helps us to determine the size and layout of the dance floor.</li>
<li><b>Lecture Room</b> - consists of rows of tables, a lecture table and plenty of chairs. 
The hotel will provide glasses and water.</li> 
<li><b>Workshop Room</b> - includes a centralized table setup to facilite group work.  It'll also
include some basic supplies for sewing and crafting, but if you need something specific that you 
cannot transport yourself, please let us know.</li>
</ul>

In any room, if you move chairs or tables, please move it back at the end of the class.
</P>


<H3><I><A name=EquipmentService>Special Equipment</A></I></H3>
<P>Please let us know far in advance if you require special equipment.  The classroom spaces
do not include whiteboards or projectors.  We cannot arrange these things on advanced notice, 
so please check in with us before planning on these presentation tools.</p>

<p>A speaker set is not considered "special" - we have 3 speakers which can be attached to 
any headphone jack.  If you require a CD player or other device, please give us <i>advanced</i> notice.

<H3><I><A name=FoodService>Food at The Conference</A></I></H3>
<p>The hotel will be providing a daytime cafe where sandwiches and light snacks can be purchased.  
There is no complimentary lunch service.  If you've purchased the Whole Shebang pass, a morning 
breakfast is provided both days.</p>

<H3><I><A name=OpsService>Ops Staff</A></I></H3>
<P>
The Expo Operations Staff are available throughout the Conference to assist you. 
If you need anything from the hotel staff, please contact Ops or Scandal from Bohemia, our 
Conference Coordinator.  A member of the security staff will be available in the class hallway
throughout the conference, checking badges to make sure that classes are available to registered 
attendees only.  Please be sure you have your badge with you.
