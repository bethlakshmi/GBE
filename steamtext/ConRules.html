<h1><? echo (USE_CON_SHORT_NAME ? CON_SHORT_NAME : CON_NAME) ?> Rules</h1>

<h2>The Most Important Rule of All</h2>
<p>
Have a good time! Have a great time! Have a grand time! Just have fun!
</p>

<h2>Do Unto Others</h2>
<p>
Treat other convention attendees and hotel guests in a generally civilized
fashion.  Abusive, insulting, intimidating, bothersome, or outwardly illegal
behavior will not be tolerated.
</p>


<h2>Communicate With Your GMs</h2>
<p>
If you know in advance that you cannot make an event that involved precasting characters, please let the GMs or 
Operations Staff know, so that the GMs can make proper arrangements.  If you are more than 10 minutes late for a game, 
you may be recast/dropped at the event runners' discretion.

<h1>Convention Policies</h1>

<h2>Game Registration Policy</h2>
<p><? echo CON_NAME ?> follows a strict first come, first serve policy when it comes to game registrations.</p>

<p>The only exception to this policy is if there is some legal restriction that should exclude a player from a game. 
For example, if a game is a live combat game, there may be insurance reasons that require restrictions, 
such as insurance waivers for pregnant women and players under the age of 16. In these cases, 
it will be clear from the game description.</p>

<h2>Harassment Policy</h2>
<p>All attendees at <? echo CON_NAME ?> are expected to treat other attendees, guests, staff, and the general 
    public with respect. Physical and verbal harassment and sexual assault will not be tolerated.  
    Roleplaying can be an intense activity, and the con staff wishes to provide a safe environment for the con-goers.  
    If you experience harassment or if someone is making you uncomfortable, please inform the Con Chair or 
    Operations Staff so we can handle the problem.</p>

<h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
