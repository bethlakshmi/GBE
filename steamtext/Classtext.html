<br /><br />
A <i>Lecture</i> is a class taught by one or two people in which the 
information flows primarily from the instructor(s) to the students.  
They can be intellectual or physical.  An example of a lecture might be 
"The History of Burlesque", "Taxes for Performers", "Marketing Yourself and Your Work", 
and "Audio Editing 101".  The room will be set in a classic class room style, with 
long tables, chairs, and a desk and chair for the presenter.
<br /><br />
<i>Movement Classes</i> are physically active classes taught in a wide open space.  They
can be physical skill, including dance, circus arts, theater or something completely different.
Examples include - "Chair Dance Basics", "The Arms and Hands of a Dancer" and 
"Limber Up! Improving Flexibility".  The space will be a carpeted, private, wide open space with 
limited mirror access.  A dance surface will be installed in the center of the room with wall 
to wall carpeting at the edges. <br /><br />
A <i>Workshop</i> is a hands-on, practical, class, usually two-hours long.
Participants in workshops learn a skill or craft that is taught through 
doing.  Workshops often have a materials fee associated with them.  
Examples of a workshop might be "Making a Tiny Little Top Hat" or 
"How to Decorate a Bra".  The room setup will accommodate hands on work with tables and chairs
arranged in a way that facilitates instructor led hands on work, and basic sewing supplies can
be provided (scissors, basic thread, pins, needs, glue) - instructors are expected to bring 
any materials that are consumed during the course of the class.  Please include any tools not listed above
 if they cannot be provided by the instructor.<br />
