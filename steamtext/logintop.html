<p><big><strong>The Great Burlesque Exposition of 2014 will <em>not</em> be on Easter weekend!&nbsp;Mark your calendar for Feb. 7-10, 2014.</strong></big></p>
<p>We had an amazing time at The Great Burlesque Exposition of 2013! So 
many of you who were there asked about signing up for 2013 - and so many
 folks who missed it swore they won't miss the next one. We're coming up
 on our eighth year. &nbsp;Since we're a week before Valentine's Day, 
our theme is <em>In Love With Burlesque!</em></p>
