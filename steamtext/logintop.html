<p><big><strong>The Great Burlesque Exposition of 2014 will <em>not</em> be on Easter weekend!&nbsp;Mark your calendar for Feb. 7-10, 2014.</strong></big></p>
<p>We had an amazing time at The Great Burlesque Exposition of 2013! So 
many of you who were there asked about signing up for 2013 - and so many
 folks who missed it swore they won't miss the next one. We're coming up
 on our eighth year. &nbsp;Since we're a week before Valentine's Day, 
our theme is <em>In Love With Burlesque!</em></p>
<p>We are limiting registration to <strong>300&nbsp;</strong>people - 
and we expect to sell out. &nbsp;We are offering a limited number (20) 
of discounted early-bird registrations until May 31. &nbsp;These 
registrations are only $99.00 Once they're gone (there are 16 left) or 
after May 31, we will offer a limited number of $125.00 registrations.</p>
