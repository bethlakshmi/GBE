<h1>Frequently Asked Questions - The Great Burlesque Exposition Conference</h1>

<h3><a name="classtypes">What types of classes does the Expo want?</a></h3>
<p>The Great Burlesque Expo strives for a balance of classic and neo 
classes, basic and advanced classes, and movement and lecture classes, 
so propose anything you wish!  Our classes do tend to cover specific 
points of burlesque, so a class on, for example, glove removal is more 
useful than a class trying to cover all points of burlesque movement, 
costuming, etiquette, and history.
</p>
<h3><a name="perfectfit">What if my class is not a perfect fit for the Expo?</a></h3>
<p>
If a concept intrigues us but we don't feel that we can use it as written, 
we may contact you about adapting it.  We may also find that we have a 
panel where your skills could be utilized and ask you if you would consider 
speaking on that.
</p>
<h3><a name="attendees">What types of people attend the Expo?</a></h3>
<p>
The Expo attracts burlesque performers from newbies to legends.  We also 
get emcees, producers, women's studies majors, documentarians, etc.  
Anyone with an involvement or interest in burlesque is welcome.
</p>

<h3><a name="length">How long are classes?</a></h3>
<p>
Most classes are a psychiatrist's hour long (meaning they are scheduled on 
the hour but end after fifty minutes so participants can get to the 
following class in a relaxed manner).  We have some two hour slots 
which are mostly reserved for hands on classes such as sewing or 
make up application.  </p>

<h3><a name="speciallength">Can my class be an hour and a half long?</a></h3>
<p>Scheduling and room availability makes this not currently viable.  
If you feel your class is longer than an hour, you are welcome to break 
it into two parts and submit both separately. </p>

<h3><a name="howmany">How many classes may I submit?</a></h3>
<p>
You may submit as many as you wish though you may not get picked for 
all of them.  We do not wish to overload the teachers, and participants 
like to hear many different viewpoints on burlesque.
</p>
<h3><a name="newclass">Do I need to have taught this class before?</a></h3>
<p>Not necessarily.  Teaching experience lets us know that you are 
comfortable addressing large groups, but we will review your 
submission if this is a new class or if you are new to teaching.  
</p>
<h3><a name="money">Is there monetary compensation for teaching at the Expo?</a></h3>
<p>As of now, unfortunately, no.  We are working on making the Expo large 
enough to make this possible in the future.  You will receive a discount on 
the conference which is proportional to how many classes you teach.</p>
<h3><a name="performing">I have applied to perform.   May I also still teach?</a></h3>
<p>
Yes.  The performance and education committees are separate, so one does 
not influence the other.  If you are accepted for both, we will schedule 
your class so it does not interfere with tech rehearsal.  We do request that you let 
us know if you are not planning on attending if you are not chosen to 
perform.  We have educators on a waiting list who wish to finalize their 
plans.</p>
