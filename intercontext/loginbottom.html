<p><?echo CON_NAME;?> is brought to you by
<a href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org">NEIL</a>,
New England Interactive Literature, as one of the semi-annual Live
Action Role-Playing conventions of the
<a href="http://www.larpaweb.net" target=_blank>Live Action
RolePlayers Association</a>. It's a convention dedicated to LARPs,
LARPers and LARPing. It's also more than just games, though! There
will be vendors, parties, social get-togethers, and other
LARP-related events.</p>
<p>Our goal is to bring together the best LARPs we can find, of all
styles and genres, in one weekend, so that you can't help but find
a game or three (or five!) that you just have to play. We are
<a href="Bids.php">always looking</a> for new and different
styles of games, for short games, long games, small games and
bigger games.  We always have a great crowd of wonderful LARPers
waiting to get into character and costume. It doesn't matter if
this is your first experience with a LARP convention or if you're
an old hand; there's something for everyone, and we try to help
newcomers fit right in.</p>
<p>Intercons are organized and run by a large group of volunteers,
all of whom are LARP enthusiasts. We
<a href="Static.php?page=volunteering">welcome new people</a> to
the process.</p>
