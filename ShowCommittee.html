<H1 align=center>Welcome to the GBE Show  Committee!</H1>
<H2>Our goal</H2>
The goal of the Show Committee is to solicit and select the best 
possible acts for all shows of the upcoming convention.

<H2>Responsibilities of the Committee</H2>
<H3>Evaluate act bids, as they come in:</H3>
<P>As bids come in, the Chair will notify the Committee about new 
submissions. They will appear on the website, in the <A 
href="Acts.php?action=52">Status of Acts link</A>. Read through them. Look at
each bid cooly and objectively. Ask yourself: 
<UL>
<LI>Is it an act that people will enjoy? 
<LI>Does it fit the rules of the show in terms of length, subject matter or other content? 
<LI>Is it a performer who is volunteering or is likely to contribute to the Expo? 
<LI>Is this a performer that meets the basic experience levels or other criteria for the show? 
<LI>Is there any reason not to accept the act? 
<LI>Will the act bring people into the show? </LI></UL>
<P>
Raise any questions or objections you might have with the rest of the  
committee. Tell us why you vote yes, no, or can't tell yet on the act. Be 
explicit in your reasons. Don't be shy. <B><I>These email discussions MUST be 
private and off-the-record. They are not for public consumption, and may be 
"politically incorrect".</I></B> 
<P>
If you have some specific issue that isn't something that you're willing to 
put before the Committee, then please let the Chair know. It's important 
that all the relevant information about a game and a GM is put before the 
committee in some fashion. 
<P>
If you are the performer of the act, then please recuse 
yourself from the voting. If you have a reason to be personally biased, please mention it
 in your feedback
<P>
<B>Timeliness is important here!</B> Please try to be prompt about your responses and followups, 
so that we can come to consensus quickly. We expect to respond to the submittor within 4 weeks. 
   discussions of a bid should be wrapped up within 2 weeks.
<P>
<B>The Chair <I>must</I> be the conduit for raising the questions with the performance submitter, if 
there are any that come up in discussions.</B> It's better if we have one voice doing the 
asking, instead of a potential perfomer being bombarded from several of us at once. The 
Chair may choose to delegate the conduit responsibility for a specific communication to one of you, if it makes sense. 
<P>
Historically, we tend to err on the side of giving as many opportunities as possible. 
In particular, we weigh heavily on the side of include people who have a history of working
hard with the Expo, and those who are solidly committed to the success of the overall event.  
We also have generally been willing to adjust expectations within reason to increase opportunities 
for well organized bids.  And we prefer complete and well documented information.
