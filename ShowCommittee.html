<H1 align=center>Welcome to the Intercon Bid Committee!</H1>
<H2>Our goal</H2>
The goal of the Bid Committee is to solicit and select the best possible schedule of games for the upcoming convention.

<H2>Responsibilities of the Bid Committee</H2>
<H3>Evaluate game bids for the con, as they come in:</H3>
<P>As bids come in, the Bid Chair will notify the Committee about new 
submissions. They will appear on the con website, in the <A 
href="Bids.php?action=52">Review Bids link</A>. Read through them. Look at
each bid cooly and objectively. Ask yourself: 
<UL>
<LI>Is it a game that people will enjoy? 
<LI>Is it an interesting game? 
<LI>Is it a game that's different from games already accepted for the 
convention? 
<LI>Is this a game that helps to create a rich and varied mix of games at the 
con? 
<LI>Is it a game that will fit in the typical Intercon environment? (<I>e.g. 
</I>A game for 100 probably doesn't fly.) 
<LI>Is this a game that will appeal to the typical Intercon audience? 
<LI>Is the author known? Do they have a track record? Is it a good one? Has this 
author bid games for Intercons before? Have they pulled their bids? 
<LI>Is the author new? If so, is the game and the author worthy of taking a 
chance on? We want to encourage new authors. 
<LI>Is the game premise stale and cliche? If it is, do you think the GM can make 
it work? (A well-written game from a good GM in a "stale" genre is often 
worthwhile.) 
<LI>Can we schedule the game reasonably timewise? (<I>e.g. </I>A weekend long 
game is harder to schedule and fill than a 4 hour game.) 
<LI>Will the game bring people into the con? </LI></UL>
<P>
Raise any questions or objections you might have with the rest of the bid 
committee. Tell us why you vote yes, no, or can't tell yet on the game. Be 
explicit in your reasons. Don't be shy. <B><I>These email discussions MUST be 
private and off-the-record. They are not for public consumption, and may be 
"politically incorrect".</I></B> If the game looks like a typical 
"we-know-it's-going-to-suck-White-Wolf-cliche", then say so. If you know the GM 
had players that walked away from a game <I>en masse</I>, then say so. It's much 
better to reject a game early and then work harder to get a better one than to 
have players gripe after the con. It is not necessary for us to accept every 
game that comes in. 
<P>
If you have some specific issue that isn't something that you're willing to 
put before the Bid Committee, then please let the Bid Chair know. It's important 
that all the relevant information about a game and a GM is put before the 
committee in some fashion. 
<P>
If you are the author of the game, or one of the GMs, then please recuse 
yourself from the voting. Feel free to answer any questions about the game, but 
remember, we need to talk freely and openly about the game. 
<P>
<B>Timeliness is important here!</B> Please try to be prompt about your responses and followups, so that we can come to consensus quickly. We expect to respond to the submittor within 4 weeks.  Bid Committee discussions of a bid should be wrapped up within 2 weeks.
<P>
<B>The Bid Chair <I>must</I> be the conduit for raising the questions with the GMs, if there are any that come up in discussions.</B> It's better if we have one voice doing the asking, instead of a potential GM being bombarded from several of us at once. The Bid Chair may choose to delegate the conduit responsibility for a specific GM to one of you, if it makes sense. 
<P>
There's also a consideration, less common but occasionally important, about whether the game and/or GMs are going to cause problems for the convention. GMs 
who are known to be a major pain in the ass to work with logistically should be 
looked at skeptically. 
<P>
Historically, we tend to err on the side of giving games a chance. That's allowed one or two bad LARPs to get through, but it's also given a lot of new GMs a chance to stretch themselves. This is generally the right attitude. That said, if we do have reason to suspect that the game <I>is</I> going to be bad, we shouldn't hesitate to kill it.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<h3>Solicit game bids for the con from GMs:</h3>
<p>
Point potential bidders at the <a href="biddingAGame.php">Bid a Game</a> link.
<p>
While it is the responsibility of everyone on the con staff to do this recruiting, we are the people who have to know what the con is looking for and what we've already seen. As such, we're in the best position to be proactive about the process. We each have contacts and connections in various places. Use them. It's up to us to reach out to those contacts and find games for the con. 
<p>
Please let the Bid Chair know who you're contacting, if you don't CC them on 
any solicitation email. The Bid Chair will keep a master list of contacts, so that 
we know the state of our efforts and don't duplicate efforts.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<h2>What's NOT the Responsibility of the Bid Committee</h2>
<p>
Each game should be evaluated on its own merits. Whether or not the game 
actually fits into the current con schedule should <I>not</I> be a 
consideration. Whether or not a game actually fits into the current con function 
space allotment should <I>not</I> be a consideration. These are important 
considerations, but time and space may be more fluid than are apparent. There 
may be alternatives that allow a game to fit into the schedule. That's best left 
to the GM Liaison, the Hotel Liaison, the Game Scheduler and the Con Chair to 
figure out.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
The Bid Chair will inform the Bid Committee that it's time to discuss a specific game or set of games. Email discussing the game should be sent to the entire bid committee. The Bid Chair will encourage the committee to find a consensus. 
<p>
Once the Committee has evaluated a game, the Bid Chair will pass the recommendation to the Con Chair for final approval. The Bid Chair will also let the Con Chair know about any bids we reject. In the end, it's the Con Chair's final call, although it's highly doubtful that the Con Chair would go against our suggestions. Please let the Bid Chair be the conduit here as well. The Con Chair has a lot on their plate; it's best if there's a single channel for Bid Committee communications. 
<p>
When a game bid is accepted or rejected, the Bid Chair will send a note to the GM informing them of the decision, copying the GM Liaison. At that point, the GM Liaison takes over the process of managing the game for the con. Our job, as the Bid Committee, is done for that game.

<h3>Fast-tracking</h3>
<p>
There may be times when a game needs to be fast-tracked.  Fast-tracking must be a concensus between the Bid Chair and Con Chair.  In those cases, the Bid Chair is the representative of the Bid Committee, and should inform the Bid Committee about the game as soon as possible.  Fast-tracking should only be used when there's extreme time pressure and the Bid Committee cannot be convened.
